# Bookmark Clone
In this repository I'll be developing **https://bookmarkextension.vercel.app/** page clone in stages. The objective of this exercise is to show my capacity to paginate and layout complex designs with different tecnologies:

1. Htlm & CSS Vanilla
2. SASS integration
3. TailWind integration

Stages will be stored in different branches using a **GitFlow workflow** model, always prioritizing a **mobile-first** approach.

## Vanilla 
For this fase of the project I needed to stay simple and use basics tecnologies without any frameworks or libraries :

### Built with:
1. Html5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript ES6

 I tried to use as much **semantic tags** as I could, **kebab-case** for class naming in CSS and `alt` attribute for accessibility

To display the project you can clone this repository, no further inastallations are required.
