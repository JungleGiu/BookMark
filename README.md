# Bookmark Clone
In this repository I'll be developing **https://bookmarkextension.vercel.app/** page clone in stages. The objective of this exercise is to show my capacity to paginate and layout complex designs with different tecnologies:

1. Htlm & CSS Vanilla
2. SASS integration
3. TailWind integration

Stages will be stored in different branches using a **GitFlow workflow** model, always prioritizing a **mobile-first** approach.

## SASS 


### Built with:
1. Html5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript ES6
4. SASS

 I tried to use as much **semantic tags** as I could, **snake-case** for class BEM naming and `alt` attribute for accessibility
